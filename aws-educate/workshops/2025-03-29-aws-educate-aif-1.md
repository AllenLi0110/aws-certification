# 2025/03/29 AWS Educate Workshop 2

Today, Kerwin and I joined the AWS Educate workshop. We learned how to use Amplify and Bedrock to build an AI project. The workshop covered model selection, agent workflow, and how to deploy both frontend and backend. We built an AI agent that can analyze concert data and create business charts. This practical experience showed us how to use AI in real-world projects.
