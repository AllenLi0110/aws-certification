1. A company is building a solution to generate images for protective eyewear. The solution must have high accuracy and must minimize the risk of incorrect annotations. Which solution will meet these requirements?

```
Human-in-the-loop validation by using Amazon SageMaker Ground Truth Plus
```

2. A company needs to choose a model from Amazon Bedrock to use internally. The company must identify a model that generates responses in a style that the company's employees prefer. What should the company do to meet these requirements?

```
Evaluate the models by using a human workforce and custom prompt datasets.
```

3. A company wants to build an interactive application for children that generates new stories based on classic stories. The company wants to use Amazon Bedrock and needs to ensure that the results and topics are appropriate for children. Which AWS service or feature will meet these requirements?

```
Guardrails for Amazon Bedrock
```

4. An AI practitioner has build a deep learning model to classify the types of materials in images. The AI practitioner now wants to measure the model performance. Which metric will help the AI practitioner evaluate the performance of the model?

```
Confusion matrix
```

5. A company is developing an ML model to make loan approvals. The company must implement a solution to detect bias in the model. The company must also be able to explain the model's predictions. Which solution will meet these requirements?

```
Amazon SageMaker Clarify
```

6. This question focuses on bias detection and model prediction explanation, both of which are crucial for ensuring fairness and interpretability in machine learning models.

```
Extracting the prompt template
```

7. A company wants to create a chatbot by using a foundation model(FM) on Amazon Bedrock. The FM needs to access encrypted data that is stored in an Amazon S3 bucket. The data is encrypted with Amazon S3 managed keys(SSE-S3). The FM encounters a failure when attempting to access the S3 bucket data. Which solution will meet these requirements?

```
Ensure that the role that Amazon Bedrock assumes has permission to decrypt data with the correct encryption key.
```

8. A research company implemented a chatbot by using a foundation model(FM) from Amazon Bedrock. The chatbot searches for answers to questions from a large database of research papers. After multiple prompt engineering attempts, the company notices that the FM is performing poorly because of the complex scientific terms in the research papers. How can the company improve the performance of the chatbot?

```
Use domain adaptation fine-tuning to adapt the FM to complex scientific terms.
```

9. An AI practitioner is developing a prompt for an Amazon Titan model. The model is hosted on Amazon Bedrock. The AI practitioner is using the model to solve numerical reasoning challenges. The AI practitioner adds the following phrase to the end of the prompt: "Ask the model to show its work by explaining its reasoning step by step." Which prompt engineering technique is the AI practitioner using?

```
Chain-of-thought prompting
```

10. A company wants to use a large language model(LLM) on Amazon Bedrock for sentiment analysis. The company needs the LLM to produce more consistent responses to the same input prompt. Which adjustment to an inference parameter should the company make to meet these requirements?

```
Decrease the temperature value
```
