C. Sample data for training
D. Model convergence tables
answer: B
```

3. An AI practitioner is using a large language model (LLM) to create content for marketing campaigns. The generated content sounds plausible and factual but is incorrect. Which problem is the LLM having?

```
A. Data leakage
B. Hallucination
C. Overfitting
D. Underfitting
answer: B
```

4. A company is building an application that needs to generate synthetic data that is based on existing data. Which type of model can the company use to meet this requirement?

```
A. Generative adversarial network (GAN)
B. XGBoost
C. Residual neural network
D. WaveNet
answer: A

5. What are tokens in the context of generative AI models?

```
A. Tokens are the basic units of input and output that a generative AI model operates on,representing words, subwords, or other linguistic units.
B. Tokens are the mathematical representations of words or concepts used in generative AI models.
C. Tokens are the pre-trained weights of a generative AI model that are fine-tuned for specific tasks.
D. Tokens are the specific prompts or instructions given to a generative AI model to generate output
answer: A
```

6. A company is using domain-specific models. The company wants to avoid creating new models from the beginning. The company instead wants to adapt pre-trained models to create models for new, related tasks. Which ML strategy meets these requirements?

```

```
A. Training
B. Inference
C. Model deployment
D. Bias correction
answer: B
```

8. A company is developing a new model to predict the prices of specific items. The model performed well on the training dataset. When the company deployed the model to production, the model's performance decreased significantly. What should the company do to mitigate this problem?

B. Add hyperparameters to the model.
C. Increase the volume of data that is used in training.
D. Increase the model training time.
answer C
```

9. A company is building a chatbot to improve user experience. The company is using a large language model (LLM) from Amazon Bedrock for intent detection.
