answer: C
```

4. Which strategy will determine if a foundation model (FM) effectively meets business objectives?

```
A. Evaluate the model's performance on benchmark datasets.
B. Analyze the model's architecture and hyperparameters.
C. Assess the model's alignment with specific use cases.
D. Measure the computational resources required for model deployment.
answer: C
```

5. A software company builds tools for customers. The company wants to use AI to increase software development productivity. Which solution will meet these requirements?

```
A. Use a binary classification model to generate code reviews.
B. Install code recommendation software in the company's developer tools.
C. Install a code forecasting tool to predict potential code issues.
D. Use a natural language processing (NLP) tool to generate code.
answer: B
```

6. A company wants to assess the costs that are associated with using a large language model (LLM) to generate inferences. The company wants to use Amazon Bedrock to build generative AI applications. Which factor will drive the inference costs?

```
A. Number of tokens consumed
B. Temperature value
C. Amount of data used to train the LLM
D. Total training time
answer: A
```

7.An AI practitioner is using a large language model (LLM) to create content for marketing campaigns. The generated content sounds plausible and factual but is incorrect. Which problem is the LLM having?

```
A. Data leakage
B. Hallucination
C. Overfitting
D. Underfitting
answer: B
```

8.Which strategy evaluates the accuracy of a foundation model (FM) that is used in image classification tasks?

```
A. Calculate the total cost of resources used by the model.
B. Measure the model's accuracy against a predefined benchmark dataset.
C. Count the number of layers in the neural network.
D. Assess the color accuracy of images processed by the model.
answer: B
```

9. An education provider is building a question and answer application that uses a generative AI model to explain complex concepts. The education provider wants to automatically change the style of the model response depending on who is asking the question. The education provider will give the model the age range of the user who has asked the question. Which solution meets these requirements with the LEAST implementation effort?

```
A. Fine-tune the model by using additional training data that is representative of the various age ranges that the application will support.
B. Add a role description to the prompt context that instructs the model of the age range that the response should target.
C. Use chain-of-thought reasoning to deduce the correct style and complexity for a response suitable for that user.
D. Summarize the response text depending on the age of the user so that younger users receive shorter responses.
answer: B
```

10. A company wants to use a large language model (LLM) on Amazon Bedrock for sentiment analysis. The company needs the LLM to produce more consistent responses to the same input prompt. Which adjustment to an inference parameter should the company make to meet these requirements?

```
A. Decrease the temperature value.
B. Increase the temperature value.
C. Decrease the length of output tokens.
D. Increase the maximum generation length.
answer: A
```
