1.A company has petabytes of **unlabeled customer data** to use for an advertisement campaign. The company wants to classify its customers into tiers to advertise and promote the company's products. Which methodology should the company use to meet these requirements?

```
Unsupervised learning
沒有標籤（答案）時，就用無監督學習。
```

2.A company makes **forecasts** each quarter to decide how to optimize operations to meet expected demand. The company uses **ML models** to make these forecasts. An AI practitioner is writing a report about the trained ML models to provide transparency and explainability to company stakeholders. What should the AI practitioner include in the report to meet the **transparency** and **explainability** requirements?

```
Partial dependence plots (PDPs)
PDPs 解釋模型怎麼根據特徵做出預測，符合解釋需求。
```

3.An AI practitioner is using a **large language model (LLM)** to create content for marketing campaigns. The **generated content** **sounds plausible and factual but is incorrect**. Which problem is the LLM having?

```
Hallucination
這是 LLM 捏造資訊（幻覺) 的典型現象，看起來對其實是錯的。
```

4.A company is building an application that needs to **generate synthetic data** that is based on **existing data**. Which type of model can the company use to meet this requirement?

```
Generative adversarial network (GAN)
GAN 是專門用來根據現有資料生成逼真的新資料的模型。
```

5.What are tokens in the context of generative AI models?

```
Tokens are the basic units of input and output that a generative AI model operates on, representing words, subwords, or other linguistic units.
Tokens 是生成式 AI 模型運作的基本單位，可以是單詞、子詞或其他語言單位。
```

6.A company is using domain-specific models. The company wants to avoid creating new models from the beginning. The company instead wants to **adapt pre-trained models** to create models for new, related tasks. Which ML strategy meets these requirements?

```
Use transfer learning.
Transfer learning 是利用預訓練模型，將其調整應用到新任務，避免從零開始訓練模型。
```
